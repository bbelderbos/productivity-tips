# Productivity Tips

This sparked our interest the other day asking what folks are struggling with:

> I wonder if someone could write about how you can make time to fit some programming in everyday, what people do to focus, what people use to manage their lists of things to do. Possibly a bit whisy washy but I know that these are the biggest things I struggle with, ie not have the time to do the stuff I have and want to do while ever increasing my list of things I need and want to do, Iâ€™m sure others are the same, might be a useful discussion

We seriously want to do an article on this, but way more fun/interesting is to have a panel of N developers answering this question.

So we created this repo to contribute: [raise issues for ideas/brainstorming](https://github.com/pybites/productivity-tips/issues) and/or [PR writings](https://github.com/pybites/productivity-tips/pulls).

To a more productive life!
